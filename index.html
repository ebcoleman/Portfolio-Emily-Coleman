                    <p class="text-center">My name is Emily Coleman. I am 30 years old and a Virginia native. My family and I moved to Michigan in November of 2021. A majority of my work history has been shipping and receiving but I am currently looking to make a change. I am going through a web developer bootcamp through Michigan State University with hopes of starting a new carreer, once completed. </p>

<!-- 
## User Story

```
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
```


## Acceptance Criteria

Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring managerâ€™s needs:

WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others

WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
